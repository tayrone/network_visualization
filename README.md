Genetic regulatory networks are comprised by a set of molecular regulators that interact 
with each other to ultimately regulate gene expression levels in the cell.

Herein, several visualizations are created using networks previously inferred for three 
of the [medulloblastoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulloblastoma) subgroups.

If you are interested in how the regulatory networks were infered, head to my
[medulloblatoma expression analysis](https://github.com/tayrone/expression_analysis) repository.
