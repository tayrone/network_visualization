Genetic regulatory networks are comprised by a set of molecular regulators that interact 
with each other to ultimately regulate gene expression levels in the cell.

Herein, visualizations were created on networks previously inferred for three 
of the [medulloblastoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulloblastoma) subgroups, 
using the [RedeR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RedeR.html) package.

If you are interested in how the regulatory networks were inferred, head to my
[medulloblatoma expression analysis](https://github.com/tayrone/expression_analysis) repository.
